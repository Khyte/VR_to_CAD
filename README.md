VR to CAD is an application for creating 3D objects for CAD in virtual reality.
You can create primitives (cube, sphere, cone, ...) with simple tools, like in Tilt Brush from Google. We made this school project to check the possibility to create objects in VR, export them in .obj and recover them in CAD software.
